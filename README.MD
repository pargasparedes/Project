-----YOU!-----
Our project is a fun interactive and customizable way to figure out your next viewing experience! 

The user will be greeted with the landing page you see below you; There are plenty of interactive links to choose from, all of which will bring you an array of options to pick from for your viewing pleasure.

The user can pick from one of the links in the Navbar section if they may want a fast easy list to lookg through; Or alternatively, if they choose they may hit the center button to pull up a three part questionnaire. From here we can narrow down the approch and get something the user may be in the mood for.

The questions are easy, just a simple list of likes and dislikes to help us relay the correct movie of choice.
